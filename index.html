        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p> 
            Graduated and received a bachelor's degree at the National Technical University of Ukraine "Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute" specialty: "Optical Technologies", and diploma of junior specialist at the State Higher Educational Institution "Kyiv Energetic College", specialty: "Installation and operation of equipment for nuclear power plants" <br>
            Since 2014 I have been working in a small company producing various printing products. <br>
            In 2022, I stumbled upon free online programming courses from RS-School and decided to try becoming a web developer. From my school years to this day, I have been interested in what is happening in the world of technology and in particular in the IT. Modern technologies, gadgets, automation of various processes, creation of functional, beautiful and at the same time easy-to-use interfaces - what makes the life of modern people easier and more comfortable, allows to spend less time on boring routine tasks.
